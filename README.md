This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/), in Clojure.

### Why Clojure?

I'm in the process of learning the functional programming paradigm, and what could be a better chance to apply what I learned than Advent of Code.

In my experience, functional programming and Advent of Code's problems are a perfect match since each problem divides into two subtasks. And I can quickly build up a set of constraint predicate for the last task.

Clojure provides massive vocabularies thanks to [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/). Solving a problem is like building a sentence from a set of phrases. I found this approach so fun, creative, and powerful.

Merry Christmas 2020, everyone!
